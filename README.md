# BinomialDistribution
This is an experimentation to verify the Binomial Distribution and plot it using matplotlib library. At first I have calculated the theoretical probabilites for various number of success/Head. I have printed the Binomial Distribution probabilities

After this I have simulated the coin tosses and calculated the number of occurrences for different number of successess/Head as per the experiment multiplier

Lastly I have physically performed the experiment by tossing coins

In the above three parts I have theoretically, experimentally and physically compared the various probabilies of getting success by tossing coins which
follows the Binomial Distribution
